    q: "Regarding AD prevention, what outcome was found in two large RCTs concerning the daily application of emollients during the first 8 to 12 months of life?",
    options: ["It significantly reduced the incidence of AD in all high-risk infants", "It did not reduce the incidence of AD, and one study showed a mildly increased rate of skin infections", "It reduced the risk of developing subsequent food allergies", "It altered the skin microbiome composition favorably"],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: "Two large RCTs found that daily emollient application $\pm$ adding oil to the bath water during the first 8 to 12 months of life did not reduce the incidence of AD; in one of the studies, emollient use was associated with a mildly increased rate of skin infections [59]."
