    const questions = 
        [
  {
    q: "Seborrheic dermatitis is strongly linked to which commensal organism, a finding corroborated by the efficacy of systemic ketoconazole treatment?",
    options: ["Cutibacterium acnes", "Staphylococcus aureus", "Malassezia (Pityrosporum) spp.", "Candida albicans"],
    answer: 2,
    explanation: "Seborrheic dermatitis is strongly linked to Malassezia yeasts [1]. It is accepted that several species of Malassezia, including M. furfur, play a direct role [1, 2]. The disease could be suppressed by systemic ketoconazole, confirming this link [1]."
  },
  {
    q: "The adult form of seborrheic dermatitis typically peaks in which age range?",
    options: ["First 3–4 months of life", "Second decade (10–19 years)", "Fourth to sixth decades", "Over 70 years"],
    answer: 2,
    explanation: "The adult form of seborrheic dermatitis is chronic with a peak in the fourth to sixth decades [3]."
  },
  {
    q: "Which specific change in skin surface lipids is observed in patients with seborrheic dermatitis, arguing against sebum overproduction alone as the decisive factor?",
    options: ["Increased squalene and free fatty acids", "Decreased triglycerides and cholesterol", "Elevated triglycerides and cholesterol but decreased squalene and free fatty acids", "Elevated sebum pH and ceramide levels"],
    answer: 2,
    explanation: "In patients with seborrheic dermatitis, triglycerides and cholesterol are elevated but squalene and free fatty acids are significantly decreased [4]."
  },
  {
    q: "Which neurologic disease is commonly associated with seborrheic dermatitis, sometimes linked to facial immobility resulting in greater sebum accumulation?",
    options: ["Multiple sclerosis", "Alzheimer's disease", "Epilepsy", "Parkinson disease"],
    answer: 3,
    explanation: "It is more commonly observed in patients with neurologic diseases (e.g. Parkinson disease, cerebrovascular accidents) [5]. In patients with Parkinson disease, seborrheic dermatitis is a common finding, and the facial immobility might result in a greater accumulation of sebum, facilitating Malassezia growth [6]."
  },
  {
    q: "The mildest form of seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp, characterized by diffuse fine white or greasy scaling without significant erythema, is known as what?",
    options: ["Psoriasis capitis", "Cradle cap", "Pityriasis simplex capillitii (dandruff)", "Pityriasis amiantacea"],
    answer: 2,
    explanation: "Pityriasis simplex capillitii (dandruff) is defined as a diffuse, slight to moderate, fine white or greasy scaling of the scalp and terminal hair-bearing areas of the face... but without significant erythema or irritation. This common condition may be considered the mildest form of seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp [7]."
  },
  {
    q: "In adult seborrheic dermatitis, where are the lesions preferentially found on the trunk?",
    options: ["Upper back and shoulders", "Lower flanks and abdomen", "Presternal and intertriginous areas", "Lateral aspects of the chest"],
    answer: 2,
    explanation: "If present, lesions of the trunk are preferentially found in the presternal and intertriginous areas [8]."
  },
  {
    q: "Which histologic feature characteristic of psoriasis is specifically noted as absent in older lesions of seborrheic dermatitis?",
    options: ["Irregular acanthosis", "Focal parakeratosis", "Spongiosis", "Munro microabscesses and confluent parakeratotic horny layers"],
    answer: 3,
    explanation: "Older lesions show irregular acanthosis and focal parakeratosis. The latter may appear similar to psoriasis, but exocytosis of neutrophils, Munro microabscesses, and confluent parakeratotic horny layers are absent [9]."
  },
  {
    q: "Infantile seborrheic dermatitis often results in a coherent scaly and crusty mass covering most of the scalp, referred to as what?",
    options: ["Pityriasis amiantacea", "Cradle cap", "Erythrodermic seborrheic dermatitis", "Sebopsoriasis"],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: "Initially, mild greasy scales adherent to the vertex and anterior fontanelle regions arise which may later extend over the entire scalp. Inflammation and oozing may finally result in a coherent scaly and crusty mass covering most of the scalp ('cradle cap') [10]."
  },
  {
    q: "Which differentiating factor distinguishes infantile seborrheic dermatitis from atopic dermatitis (AD) in infants?",
    options: ["Presence of greasy scale", "Involvement of the scalp", "Infants with seborrheic dermatitis generally feed well and are content", "The earlier onset of seborrheic dermatitis"],
    answer: 2,
    explanation: "Infantile seborrheic dermatitis is distinguished from atopic dermatitis by its earlier onset, different distribution pattern, and, most importantly, infants with seborrheic dermatitis generally feed well and are content [9, 11]."
  },
  {
    q: "A patient with extensive and severe seborrheic dermatitis should raise the suspicion of which underlying systemic condition?",
    options: ["Hyperhomocysteinemia", "Severe nutritional deficiency (e.g., zinc)", "HIV infection", "Chronic kidney disease"],
    answer: 2,
    explanation: "Extensive and severe seborrheic dermatitis, however, should raise the suspicion of underlying HIV infection [6]. Extensive seborrheic dermatitis can be a cutaneous sign of HIV infection [2, 5]."
  },
  {
    q: "What is the key mechanism of action of topical azoles (e.g., ketoconazole) in treating adult seborrheic dermatitis?",
    options: ["Anti-inflammatory effects only", "Keratolytic and scale reduction", "Suppression of Malassezia yeasts", "Inhibition of sebaceous gland activity"],
    answer: 2,
    explanation: "The mainstay of therapy is the use of topical azoles (e.g. ketoconazole), either as shampoos (scalp) or as creams (body). The high response rate (75%–90%) of this treatment has been documented [12]. This efficacy is due to the strong link between seborrheic dermatitis and Malassezia yeasts [1]."
  },
  {
    q: "Seborrheic dermatitis that involves the central chest sometimes exhibits which characteristic appearance?",
    options: ["Plaques resembling oil drops", "A petaloid appearance", "Coin-shaped lesions", "Serpiginous borders"],

    options: ["Butterfly distribution of lesions", "Clear photodistribution", "Involvement of the nasolabial folds", "Coexistence with rosacea"],
    answer: 2,
    explanation: "Lupus erythematosus rarely affects the nasolabial folds and often has a clearly demonstrable photodistribution [13]. Seborrheic dermatitis of the face frequently affects the nasolabial folds [8, 14]."
  },
  {
    q: "Asteatotic eczema (eczema craquelé) is characterized by superficial cracking that is said to resemble what?",
    options: ["Dried riverbed", "Shattered glass", "Tapioca pudding", "Fish scales"],
    answer: 0,
    explanation: "If more advanced, the skin exhibits a criss-cross pattern of superficial cracks and fissures of the horny layer ('crazy-paving', eczema craquelé, 'dried riverbed') [15, 16]."
  },
  {
    q: "What is the most common cause of xerosis that predisposes to asteatotic eczema?",
    options: ["HIV infection", "Chronic kidney diseases", "Aging", "Atopic dermatitis"],
    answer: 2,
    explanation: "The most common cause of xerosis is aging [17]."
  },
  {
    q: "What is the primary site of predilection for asteatotic eczema?",
    options: ["Face and neck", "Palms and soles", "Shins, lower flanks, and posterior axillary line", "Trunk and proximal extremities"],
    answer: 2,
    explanation: "Sites of predilection are the shins, lower flanks, and posterior axillary line [17]. Xerosis first arises on the shins [15]."

    explanation: "Histologically, xerotic skin appears rather normal except for a compact and slightly irregular stratum corneum [18]."
  },
  {
    q: "Which specific underlying internal malignancy, including lymphoma, should be considered when asteatotic eczema is widespread and refractory to therapy?",
    options: ["Squamous cell carcinoma", "Hepatocellular carcinoma", "Underlying neoplasm (including lymphoma)", "Melanoma"],
    answer: 2,
    explanation: "Rarely, but especially when widespread and refractory to therapy, asteatotic eczema may be related to an underlying neoplasm, including lymphoma [17]."
  },
  {
    q: "Disseminated eczema, or autosensitization, is defined by secondary lesions of eczema appearing distant from the primary site. What is a key characteristic of this secondary rash?",
    options: ["It is confined to the trunk", "It is usually unilateral", "It follows a strikingly symmetric distribution pattern", "It appears immediately after trauma"],
    answer: 2,
    explanation: "Disseminated eczema appears later than the primary lesions by a few days to weeks, tends to follow a strikingly symmetric distribution pattern, and shows a predilection for analogous anatomic sites [19]."
  },
  {
    q: "Disseminated eczema is most often observed in association with which two primary conditions?",
    options: ["Atopic dermatitis and nummular dermatitis", "Allergic contact dermatitis and stasis dermatitis", "Seborrheic dermatitis and asteatotic eczema", "Psoriasis and tinea pedis"],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: "This phenomenon... is most often observed in allergic contact dermatitis, particularly if associated with stasis dermatitis [20]. It is one of the most common causes of disseminated eczema [21]."
  },
  {
    q: "What concept, derived from routine patch testing ('excited skin syndrome,' 'angry back'), helps explain the pathogenesis of autosensitization?",
    options: ["Systemic hapten dissemination", "Lowering of the irritancy threshold of distant skin", "Autoantibody formation against epidermal antigens", "Generalized T-cell anergy"],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: "It became clear... that inflammatory processes of the skin... lower the irritancy threshold of distant skin and thus facilitate the development of an eczematous reaction [22]."
  },
  {
    q: "Which agent, when ingested by sensitized individuals, has been shown to elicit disseminated eczema, supporting the systemic dissemination theory?",
    options: ["Gluten", "Latex", "Nickel", "Cobalt"],
    answer: 2,
    explanation: "It could be allergens; for example, the ingestion of allergens such as nickel has been shown to elicit disseminated eczema in sensitized individuals [23]."
  },
  {
    q: "Nummular dermatitis (discoid eczema) is characterized by lesions that are shaped like what object?",
    options: ["Tear drops", "Monomorphic papules", "Coin-shaped", "Target lesions"],
    answer: 2,
    explanation: "Nummular dermatitis is an uncommon, disseminated eczema characterized by its coin-shaped lesions [24]. The eruption consists of round (discoid) eczematous patches [25]."
  },
  {
    q: "In adult patients with nummular dermatitis, which body sites are almost exclusively affected by the round eczematous patches?",
    options: ["Scalp and face", "Trunk and intertriginous areas", "Extremities (lower legs, forearms, dorsal hands)", "Axillae and groin"],
    answer: 2,
    explanation: "Nummular dermatitis is defined as an eruption of round (discoid) eczematous patches almost exclusively of the extremities, often the lower legs in men and the forearms and dorsal aspects of the hands in women [25]."
  },
  {
    q: "Nummular dermatitis patients frequently show positive patch test reactions, most often to which three allergens?",
    options: ["Fragrance mix, formaldehyde, Balsam of Peru", "Nickel sulfate, potassium dichromate, and cobalt chloride", "Neomycin, bacitracin, and lanolin", "Paraphenylenediamine, rubber, and pimecrolimus"],

  },
  {
    q: "In stasis dermatitis, the accumulation of extravasated erythrocytes results in deposits of what pigment?",
    options: ["Melanin", "Hemosiderin", "Bilirubin", "Fibrin"],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: "Venous hypertension... allowing the passage of fluid and plasma proteins into the tissue (edema) and extravasation of erythrocytes (stasis 'purpura' and hemosiderin deposition) [27]. Bouts of stasis purpura lead to areas of hemosiderin deposition [30]."
  },
