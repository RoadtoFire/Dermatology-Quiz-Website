    options: ["Obesity", "Metabolic syndrome", "Atopic dermatitis", "Psoriatic arthritis"],
    answer: 2,
    explanation: "There is a pronounced under-representation of allergic skin diseases in psoriasis. The frequencies of atopic dermatitis, asthma, urticaria, and allergic contact dermatitis have been found to be lower in psoriatic patients [39]."
  },
  {
    q: "Which histologic finding is considered pathognomonic for stable psoriatic plaque lesions, explaining the Auspitz phenomenon?",
    options: ["Absence of the granular layer", "Club-shaped dermal papillae with a small suprapapillary plate", "A perivascular infiltrate composed primarily of histiocytes", "Diffuse spongiosis in the stratum spinosum"],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: "In the papillary dermis, the capillaries are elongated and tortuous, extending upward into elongated club-shaped dermal papillae; only a small suprapapillary plate of epidermal cells covers the tip of these dermal papillae. This micromorphology explains the “Auspitz” phenomenon [22]."
