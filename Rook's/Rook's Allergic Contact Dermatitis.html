  },
  {
    q: "Why is identifying the site of origin of contact dermatitis an important clue to the cause?",
    options: ["It predicts the patient's eventual prognosis [28]", "By definition, contact dermatitis must begin in the sites where contact took place [29]", "It helps distinguish allergic from irritant causes, as irritant contact dermatitis does not tend to spread [29]", "It determines the type of T-cell response generated (Th1 vs Th2) [30]"],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: "By definition, contact dermatitis must begin in sites where contact has taken place with the responsible agent(s), and the sites of origin are an important clue to the cause [29]."

    answer: 3,
    explanation: "An allergen is generally suggested for inclusion in the baseline series when routine (consecutive) patch testing of patients with suspected contact dermatitis results in a proportion of contact allergy to the substance exceeding 0.5–1.0% or when this allergen is ubiquitous and/or clinically highly relevant [94]."
