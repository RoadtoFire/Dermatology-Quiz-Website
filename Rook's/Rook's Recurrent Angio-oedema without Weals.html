    [
  {
    "q": "What is the primary mediator responsible for bradykinin-induced angio-oedema?",
    "options": ["Histamine", "Leukotrienes", "Bradykinin", "Prostaglandins"],
    "answer": 2,
    "explanation": "Bradykinin-induced angio-oedema, including HAE and ACE inhibitor-induced angio-oedema, is directly caused by the vasoactive peptide bradykinin, which increases vascular permeability."
  },
  {
    "q": "Which of the following is a key feature that distinguishes mast cell mediator-induced angio-oedema from bradykinin-induced angio-oedema?",
    "options": ["Involvement of the lips", "Absence of itching", "Association with abdominal pain", "Absence of life-threatening laryngeal oedema"],
    "answer": 3,
    "explanation": "Life-threatening laryngeal obstruction is a feature of bradykinin-induced angio-oedema (e.g., HAE) but does not occur in mast cell mediator-induced angio-oedema, even though patients may report throat symptoms."
  },
  {
    "q": "What is the most common form of Hereditary Angio-oedema (HAE)?",
    "options": ["HAE with normal C1-INH (nC1-INH-HAE)", "HAE Type II (functional C1-INH deficiency)", "HAE Type I (quantitative C1-INH deficiency)", "Acquired C1-INH deficiency"],
    "answer": 2,
    "explanation": "HAE Type I, characterized by a quantitative deficiency of C1-esterase inhibitor (C1-INH), accounts for approximately 85% of all HAE cases."
  },
  {
    "q": "A patient presents with recurrent angio-oedema without weals. Their C4 level is consistently low. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": ["Chronic spontaneous urticaria", "ACE inhibitor-induced angio-oedema", "Hereditary Angio-oedema (HAE) Types I or II", "Idiopathic non-histaminergic angio-oedema"],
    "answer": 2,
    "explanation": "A low C4 level is a hallmark laboratory finding in HAE Types I and II, both during and between attacks, due to the uncontrolled activation of the complement system."
  },
  {
    "q": "Which drug class is most famously associated with inducing bradykinin-mediated angio-oedema?",
    "options": ["Beta-blockers", "Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibitors", "Calcium channel blockers", "Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)"],
    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "ACE inhibitors cause angio-oedema by inhibiting kininase II, which is responsible for breaking down bradykinin, leading to its accumulation."
  },
  {
    "q": "What is the first-line treatment for mast cell mediator-induced angio-oedema?",
    "options": ["Intravenous corticosteroids", "Subcutaneous epinephrine", "Non-sedating second-generation H1 antihistamines", "Plasma-derived C1-INH"],
    "answer": 2,
    "explanation": "Daily non-sedating, second-generation H1 antihistamines are the first-line treatment for mast cell mediator-induced angio-oedema, often requiring higher than standard doses."
  },
  {
    "q": "Which of the following is NOT an effective emergency treatment for an acute attack of Hereditary Angio-oedema (HAE)?",
    "options": ["Icatibant (bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist)", "Plasma-derived C1-INH concentrate", "High-dose H1 antihistamines", "Recombinant C1-INH"],
    "answer": 2,
    "explanation": "H1 antihistamines, corticosteroids, and epinephrine are ineffective for treating acute attacks of bradykinin-mediated HAE. Effective treatments target the bradykinin pathway directly."
  },
  {
    "q": "For which type of angio-oedema is a family history typically present but can also result from de novo mutations in up to 25% of cases?",
    "options": ["ACE inhibitor-induced angio-oedema", "Acquired C1-INH deficiency", "Hereditary Angio-oedema (HAE)", "Vibratory angio-oedema"],
    "answer": 2,
    "explanation": "While a family history is common in HAE, approximately 25% of cases are due to de novo mutations in the SERPING1 gene, meaning the patient is the first in their family to have the condition."
  },
  {
    "q": "Which prophylactic treatment for HAE is a small molecule oral kallikrein inhibitor?",
    "options": ["Lanadelumab", "Danazol", "Berotralstat", "Tranexamic acid"],
    "answer": 2,

  {
    "q": "What laboratory finding helps distinguish acquired C1-INH deficiency from hereditary C1-INH deficiency (HAE)?",
    "options": ["Low C4 level", "Low C1-INH function", "Low C1q level", "Presence of a paraprotein"],
    "answer": 2,
    "explanation": "A low C1q level is characteristic of acquired C1-INH deficiency (due to consumption by lymphoproliferative disorders or autoantibodies) but is normal in hereditary C1-INH deficiency."
  },
  {
    "q": "Which gene is most commonly mutated in HAE with normal C1-INH (nC1-INH-HAE) and has a link to Northern European ancestry?",
    "options": ["PLG (Plasminogen)", "F12 (Factor XII)", "ANGPT1 (Angiopoietin-1)", "KNG1 (Kininogen-1)"],
    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "Gain-of-function mutations in the F12 gene, which encodes for Factor XII, are found in a significant portion (about 20%) of nC1-INH-HAE patients and are associated with Northern European ancestry."
  },
  {
    "q": "What is the recommended first step in managing a patient with suspected ACE inhibitor-induced angio-oedema?",
    "options": ["Administer icatibant", "Start a high-dose antihistamine", "Discontinue the ACE inhibitor", "Order a C1-INH level test"],
    "answer": 2,
    "explanation": "The immediate and essential step is to stop the offending ACE inhibitor. All ACE inhibitors should be avoided in the future, and an alternative antihypertensive agent should be chosen."
  },
  {
    "q": "Which of the following is a common trigger for exacerbations in all types of Hereditary Angio-oedema (HAE)?",
    "options": ["Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)", "Exogenous oestrogen", "Beta-lactam antibiotics", "Food allergens"],
    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "Exogenous oestrogen, found in oral contraceptive pills and hormone replacement therapy, is a well-known aggravating factor for HAE attacks and should be avoided."
  },
  {
    "q": "What is the mechanism of action of the drug Icatibant?",
    "options": ["It replaces deficient C1-INH", "It inhibits plasma kallikrein", "It is a bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist", "It is an antifibrinolytic agent"],
    "answer": 2,
    "explanation": "Icatibant is a selective and specific competitive antagonist of the bradykinin B2 receptor. By blocking this receptor, it prevents bradykinin from causing vasodilation and increased vascular permeability."
  },
  {
    "q": "A prodromal 'reticulate erythema' is a characteristic feature preceding attacks in which condition?",
    "options": ["ACE inhibitor-induced angio-oedema", "Chronic spontaneous urticaria", "Hereditary Angio-oedema (HAE)", "Vibratory angio-oedema"],
    "answer": 2,
    "explanation": "Some patients with HAE experience a non-pruritic, reticulate (net-like) erythema as a prodromal sign, which may appear hours before a full-blown swelling attack."
  },
  {
    "q": "Which treatment is approved for anti-histamine refractory chronic spontaneous urticaria and associated angio-oedema?",
    "options": ["Danazol", "Omalizumab", "Icatibant", "Fresh frozen plasma"],
    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "Omalizumab, a monoclonal anti-IgE antibody, is licensed for use in patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria (and its associated angio-oedema) who remain symptomatic despite treatment with H1 antihistamines."
  },
  {
    "q": "What is the primary risk associated with the use of attenuated androgens (e.g., Danazol) for HAE prophylaxis in women?",
    "options": ["Hepatotoxicity", "Androgenic side effects", "Risk of thrombosis", "Anaphylaxis"],
    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "Androgenic side effects such as weight gain, acne, hirsutism, voice deepening, and menstrual irregularities are common and often unacceptable for female patients, limiting the use of danazol."
  },
  {
    "q": "In a patient with acquired C1-INH deficiency, what underlying condition is most commonly associated with the Type 1 form?",
    "options": ["Thyroid autoimmunity", "Lymphoproliferative disease", "Systemic lupus erythematosus", "Helicobacter pylori infection"],
    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "Type 1 acquired C1-INH deficiency is due to increased consumption of C1-INH, most commonly secondary to an underlying B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder."
  },
  {
    "q": "Which of the following is a feature of Episodic Angio-oedema with Eosinophilia (Gleich syndrome)?",
    "options": ["Progression to cardiomyopathy", "Association with IgG paraproteinaemia", "Recurrent episodes with fever and eosinophilia", "Low C4 levels during attacks"],
    "answer": 2,
    "explanation": "Gleich syndrome is characterized by recurrent episodes of angio-oedema accompanied by fever, weight gain, and marked blood eosinophilia. It does not progress to cardiomyopathy like hypereosinophilic syndrome can."
  },
  {
    "q": "What is the recommended use of plasma-derived C1-INH in the context of dental procedures for an HAE patient?",
    "options": ["As a long-term prophylaxis started years before", "As a short-term prophylaxis given shortly before the procedure", "Only as an emergency treatment if swelling occurs", "It is not recommended for dental procedures"],
    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "Short-term prophylaxis with pdC1-INH is recommended shortly before medical or dental procedures that involve trauma (like dental work or intubation) to prevent triggering an HAE attack."
  },
  {
    "q": "Which patient demographic has a significantly higher incidence of ACE inhibitor-induced angio-oedema?",
    "options": ["Children", "Women of childbearing age", "Patients of Afro-Caribbean ancestry", "Patients of East Asian ancestry"],
    "answer": 2,
    "explanation": "The incidence of ACE inhibitor-induced angio-oedema is 3.5-4.0 times higher in patients of Afro-Caribbean ancestry compared to other groups."
  },
  {
    "q": "What is the mechanism of action of Tranexamic acid when used in HAE prophylaxis?",
    "options": ["Androgenic stimulation of C1-INH production", "Direct inhibition of bradykinin B2 receptor", "Inhibition of plasminogen activation", "Monoclonal antibody against kallikrein"],
    "answer": 2,
    "explanation": "Tranexamic acid is an antifibrinolytic agent that inhibits the activation of plasminogen to plasmin. Plasmin is thought to be able to activate the kinin system, so inhibiting it can help reduce bradykinin generation."
  },
  {
    "q": "What is the inheritance pattern of Hereditary Angio-oedema (HAE)?",
    "options": ["Autosomal recessive", "X-linked recessive", "Autosomal dominant", "Mitochondrial"],
    "answer": 2,
    "explanation": "HAE Types I and II, caused by mutations in the SERPING1 gene, are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. This means a child of an affected parent has a 50% chance of inheriting the condition."
  },
  {
    "q": "Which of the following is a monoclonal antibody used for HAE prophylaxis that targets plasma kallikrein?",
    "options": ["Omalizumab", "Icatibant", "Lanadelumab", "Rituximab"],
    "answer": 2,
    "explanation": "Lanadelumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody (IgG1) that specifically binds to and inhibits plasma kallikrein, preventing the excessive generation of bradykinin. It is administered subcutaneously every 2 or 4 weeks."
  },
  {
    "q": "A patient with recurrent abdominal pain and vomiting, but no skin swelling, undergoes multiple negative surgical explorations. What condition should be suspected?",
    "options": ["Cyclic vomiting syndrome", "Hereditary Angio-oedema (HAE)", "Irritable bowel syndrome", "Mast cell mediator-induced angio-oedema"],
    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "HAE can present with severe abdominal attacks due to mucosal swelling in the bowel, causing pain, nausea, and vomiting, even in the absence of visible skin angio-oedema. This often leads to misdiagnosis and unnecessary surgery."
  },
  {
    "q": "Which complement component is typically measured as a sensitive screening test for HAE Types I and II?",
    "options": ["C1q", "C3", "C4", "C5a"],
    "answer": 2,
    "explanation": "C4 is nearly always low in patients with HAE Types I and II, both during and between attacks, making it a highly sensitive and useful initial screening test."
  },
  {
    "q": "What is the definitive test to confirm a diagnosis of HAE Type II (functional deficiency)?",
    "options": ["C4 level", "C1-INH antigenic level", "C1-INH functional assay", "Genetic testing for SERPING1"],
    "answer": 2,
    "explanation": "In HAE Type II, the C1-INH antigenic level is normal, but the protein is dysfunctional. Therefore, a functional assay of C1-INH is required to confirm the diagnosis, showing low activity."
  },
  {
    "q": "Which type of HAE is initially triggered by mutations in genes other than SERPING1 and primarily affects women?",
    "options": ["HAE Type I", "HAE Type II", "HAE with normal C1-INH (nC1-INH-HAE)", "Acquired C1-INH deficiency"],
    "answer": 2,
    "explanation": "HAE with normal C1-INH (nC1-INH-HAE) encompasses several types (e.g., FXII-HAE, PLG-HAE) caused by mutations in other genes. It was originally described almost exclusively in women."
  },
  {
    "q": "Which of the following is a potential treatment reported to be effective in some cases of autoantibody-mediated acquired C1-INH deficiency?",
    "options": ["Danazol", "Rituximab", "Berotralstat", "Omalizumab"],
    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "Rituximab, a monoclonal antibody against CD20 on B-cells, has been reported to induce long-lasting improvement in some patients with acquired C1-INH deficiency caused by autoantibodies (Type 2)."
  },
  {
    "q": "What is the recommended route of administration for Icatibant in the emergency treatment of an HAE attack?",
    "options": ["Intravenous bolus", "Subcutaneous injection", "Intramuscular injection", "Oral tablet"],
    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "Icatibant is formulated for subcutaneous injection, which allows for easy self-administration by patients at home at the first sign of an attack, leading to faster resolution of symptoms."
  },
  {
    "q": "The drug combination Sacubitril-Valsartan (ARNI) should be avoided in patients with a history of angio-oedema to which other drug class?",
    "options": ["Beta-blockers", "Calcium channel blockers", "ACE inhibitors", "Diuretics"],
    "answer": 2,
    "explanation": "Sacubitril-valsartan inhibits neprilysin, an enzyme that breaks down vasoactive peptides including bradykinin. It is contraindicated in patients with a history of ACE inhibitor-induced angio-oedema due to a similar risk profile."
  },
  {
    "q": "Which clinical feature is highly unusual in mast cell mediator-induced angio-oedema?",
    "options": ["Swelling of the lips", "Swelling of the eyelids", "Isolated abdominal pain", "Swelling resolving within 72 hours"],
    "answer": 2,
    "explanation": "Abdominal involvement due to visceral angio-oedema is a feature of bradykinin-mediated angio-oedema (e.g., HAE) and does not occur in mast cell mediator-induced angio-oedema."
  },
  {
    "q": "What is the proposed pathophysiological mechanism for ANGPT1-HAE and MYOF-HAE?",
    "options": ["Excess bradykinin formation", "VEGF receptor modulation and signal transduction", "Direct mast cell degranulation", "Autoantibodies against C1-INH"],
    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "Unlike the more common bradykinin-mediated forms, ANGPT1-HAE and MYOF-HAE are thought to be caused by dysregulation of vascular permeability through modulation of the VEGF receptor and its signaling pathways."
  },
  {
    "q": "Which of the following is a validated tool for assessing the disease impact (quality of life) in patients with recurrent angio-oedema?",
    "options": ["Angio-oedema Activity Score (AAS)", "Angio-oedema Control Test (AECT)", "Angio-oedema Quality of Life Questionnaire (AE-QoL)", "UAS7 score"],
    "answer": 2,
    "explanation": "The Angio-oedema Quality of Life Questionnaire (AE-QoL) is a specific patient-reported outcome measure designed to assess the impact of recurrent angio-oedema on a patient's quality of life."
  },
  {
    "q": "Why might symptoms of ACE inhibitor-induced angio-oedema persist for weeks or even months after stopping the drug?",
    "options": ["Due to irreversible tissue damage", "Because of long-lasting autoantibodies", "The reason is unknown", "Due to a coexisting HAE diagnosis"],
    "answer": 2,
    "explanation": "The text states that ACE inhibitor-induced angio-oedema may take up to 6 months to subside after stopping the drug, and the reason for this prolonged effect is unknown."
  },
  {
    "q": "What is the role of C1-INH in the body?",
    "options": ["It is the main enzyme that generates bradykinin", "It is a natural inhibitor of multiple protease systems", "It is a vasoactive mediator released from mast cells", "It is a complement component that causes cell lysis"],
    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "C1-esterase inhibitor (C1-INH) is a key plasma serine protease inhibitor. It regulates the contact system (inhibiting kallikrein and Factor XIIa), the complement system (inhibiting C1r and C1s), and the fibrinolytic system, preventing excessive bradykinin production."
  },
  {
    "q": "In which situation would fresh frozen plasma be a consideration for treating an HAE attack?",
    "options": ["As first-line treatment in all cases", "If dedicated C1-INH concentrates or icatibant are unavailable", "For routine long-term prophylaxis", "For treating acquired C1-INH deficiency only"],
    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "Fresh frozen plasma contains C1-INH and can be used as an alternative emergency treatment for an acute HAE attack if the specific, recommended first-line therapies (pdC1-INH, icatibant, etc.) are not available."
  },
  {
    "q": "A rare presentation of inducible urticaria that causes angio-oedema through IgE-independent mast cell degranulation is:",
    "options": ["Dermatographic urticaria", "Cold urticaria", "Vibratory angio-oedema", "Solar urticaria"],
    "answer": 2,
    "explanation": "Vibratory angio-oedema is a rare form of inducible urticaria where physical vibration triggers mast cell degranulation via a non-IgE mediated mechanism, leading to localized angio-oedema."
  },
  {
    "q": "What is a major advantage of modern therapies like subcutaneous C1-INH, lanadelumab, and berotralstat for HAE prophylaxis?",
    "options": ["They are significantly cheaper than danazol", "They have no side effects", "They allow for patient self-administration and better attack prevention", "They cure the underlying genetic defect"],
    "answer": 2,
    "explanation": "A major advancement in HAE management is the development of therapies that can be self-administered subcutaneously or orally (e.g., lanadelumab, berotralstat, SC pdC1-INH), leading to dramatically improved attack control and quality of life compared to older drugs like danazol."
