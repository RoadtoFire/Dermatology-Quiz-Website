    "options": ["Blister fluid", "Blood culture", "Swab from the apparent primary infection site", "Cerebrospinal fluid"],
    "answer": 2,
    "explanation": "The text explains that swabs from blister fluids in SSSS do not usually grow S. aureus because the blisters are sterile and mediated by circulating toxins. The staphylococci are isolated from the original, often occult, septic site (e.g., conjunctiva, wound, nasopharynx)."
